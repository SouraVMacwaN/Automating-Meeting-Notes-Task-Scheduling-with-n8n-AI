# Automating-Meeting-Notes-Task-Scheduling-with-n8n-AI
This n8n workflow automatically fetches meeting notes from Gmail, uses Google Gemini AI to extract actionable tasks, and schedules them in Google Calendar. If a task does not have a specified time, the workflow assigns a default timing 24 hours later.
